# kUML Web Development

## Added Parts

- A pinned npm/CodeMirror dependency graph and Vite bundle to prevent duplicate `@codemirror/state` instances in the browser.
- A Playwright regression test for editor startup, typing, SVG rendering, and CodeMirror browser errors.
- Gradle tasks that build the frontend before packaging Web resources.
- Docker workflows for browser testing and local self-hosting.

## Files

- `frontend/app.js` — browser application source.
- `src/main/resources/web/static/` — Ktor static resources.
- `src/main/resources/web/static/assets/` — generated Vite bundle; ignored by Git.
- `tests/editor.spec.mjs` — browser regression test.
- `tests/.output/` — generated test reports, artifacts, and server log.

## Containerized Testing

### Browser

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose -f kuml-web/.delivery/development/compose.yml run --rm --build browser-test
```

The source is mounted read-only, copied into a container workspace, built, and tested there. Inspect results in `kuml-web/tests/.output/`:

- `playwright-report/index.html`
- `playwright-test-results/`
- `kuml-web.log`

## Manual Runtime

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose -f kuml-web/.delivery/runtime/compose.yml up --build
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. The Compose mapping is localhost-only. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

## Build flow

`processResources` depends on `installWebDependencies` and `buildWebFrontend`. Therefore every Gradle distribution build packages the Vite-generated `/assets/app.js` bundle.

Do not expose `kuml serve` publicly without authentication, restricted networking, resource limits, and isolated runtime storage: submitted kUML scripts execute Kotlin code.
